        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p> What is AI? Good question. AI is short for artofficial inteligence. Basically, that means a program designed
            to simulate the human thought process. AI is everywhere. From the software that recommends you videos online
            to Tesla's autopilot. Those who design these services are known as AI engineers. </p>
        <h2> Payscale</h2>
        <p> Entry level positions start at arjund 80K. However, some high-paying positions can go up to a wapping 300K.
        </p>

        <h2> Programming languages</h2>
        <p> The most common programming languages in AI are C++ and Python. <br>
            AI engineers also need to know how to use programs to organize their data. FOr example, MongoDB, Hadoop, and
            Apache Spark. Frameworks such as PyTorch will also need to be learned, and you need a good understanding of
            math and machine algorithms as well. </p>

            engineer is and how to become one.></p>
