        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p> Everything we do with technology involves data. Data scientists are responsible for analysing said data and
            using it to give insite to or improve businesses. </p>
        <h2> Payscale</h2>
        <p> The average entry-level salary for a data scientist is $77,450. For axperienced data scientists, that can go
            up to $134,550.</p>
        <h3> Pros and cons</h3> <br>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th> Pro</th>
                <th> Con</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> Due to its versatility, you have the opportunity to work in a variety of fields</td>
                <td> The lines between data to analyse and the privacy of customers is blurry. You have to be careful
                    not to craoss it</td>

            <tr>
                <td> You have the opportunity to save lives, especially when working in the healthcare secter.</td>
                <td> There are many branches of data science, which means that it is impossible to truely master it.
                </td>

            <tr>
                <td> Good data scientists are highly in demand.</td>
                <td> You may come across companies whose data shows extreme bias or holes due to poor management. This
                    can yield unexpected or unhelpful results.</td>

        <h2> Programming languages</h2>
        <p> One of the best programming languages for data science is Python. Due to its vast number of libraries,
            Python is capable of both visualizing and analysing data. Some of the most popular python libraries are
            NumPy, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow. <br>
            Another widely used language is SQL. It is used in databases, and despite there being a variety of data
            systems to work with such as SQLite and MySQL, their syntax is extremely similar, which makes it really easy
            to learn. <br>
            There are a lot more languages that can be used in data science but these two are some of the more popular
            ones.</p>
        <h2> Resource</h2>
        <p> Remember how I mentioned there are lots more resources for data science? Well, <a
                href="https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-programming-languages-for-data-scientists-in-2022"> here</a> is
            a resource that goes through most of them and even has courses to help you learn.</p>

        <h2> Career opportunities </h2>
        <p> <a href="https://govskpsc.taleo.net/careersection/10180/joblist.ftl"> The Government of Saskatchewan</a> is
            currantly looking for a data analyst in the business sector. They would definitely be a reliable employer
            and a good one to keep an eye on, as Saskatchewan is developping at an extremely fast rate, therefore there
            are more jobs.</p> <br>
