        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p> Ever wondered how the websites you browse every day are made? Well, the answer is typically web developers.
            Web developers are responsible for every aspect of the web. From coding interactive features to designing
            the website, these people do it all.</p>
        <h2> Payscale</h2>
        <p> Entry level pay typically starts at around $50,500. Advanced positions can pay up to $80,000.. However, it
            can be more or less depending on reliability of the employer or if you are self-employed.</p>

            <tr>
                <td> Careers are flexable and positions range from specializing in one thing to everything. This means
                    you can get into it regardless of what you specialize in.</td>
                <td> May be hard for some to get started due to all of the different tools used.</td>

        <h2> Types of web developers</h2>
        <p> There are three main types of web developers. Frontend, backend, and fullstack. Each one is responsible for
            their own parts of the website's overall functioning and rely on each other. Below are the various web
            developers, along with their roles and responsibilities. </p>
        <h3> Frontend</h3>
        <p> Frontend web developers are responsible for the parts of the website that you (the user) see. They design
            the layout, create the elements, and build the interactive portions of the website.</p>
        <h3> Backend</h3>
        <p> Backend web developers are responsible for the parts of the website that you don't see. They implement
            features such as the server and databases. Backend web developers are the reason we have search features,
            accounts, online stores, and much more. Without them, websites would only have a small portion of
            interaction.</p>
        <h3> Fullstack </h3>
        <p> Fullstack web developers do it all. They are experts in both fields of web development. They are also
            typically quite knowledgeable in hosting, server management platforms, as well as business parts of the
            website.</p>
        <h2> Programming languages</h2>
        <h3> Frontend</h3>
        <p> Frontend web developers work in three main languages. HTML, which is responsible for the barebones
            elements, CSS, which is responsible for the design and colors, and Javascript, which does all of the
            interactive things. <br>
            The best way to explain it is using a sentence. for example, "The black cat pounced." <br> The cat is the
            element, black is the design, and pounce is the interaction.</p>
        <h3> Backend</h3>
        <p> Backend web developers use a lot more complex tools. They need powerful languages that are able to handle
            algorithms and other heavy tasks. Therefore, they use languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, and Javascript
            frameworks such as Node JS.</p>
